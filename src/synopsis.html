        <p class="description">
          The Kims - mother and father Chung-sook and Ki-taek, and their young
          adult offspring, son Ki-woo and daughter Ki-jung - are a poor family
          living in a shabby and cramped half basement apartment in a busy lower
          working class commercial district of Seoul. Without even knowing it,
          they, especially Mr. and Mrs. Kim, literally smell of poverty. Often
          as a collective, they perpetrate minor scams to get by, and even when
          they have jobs, they do the minimum work required.

        <p class="description">
          Ki-woo is the one who has dreams of getting out of poverty by one day
          going to university. Despite not having that university education,
          Ki-woo is chosen by his university student friend Min, who is leaving
          to go to school, to take over his tutoring job to Park Da-hye, who Min
          plans to date once he returns to Seoul and she herself is in
          university.

        <h2 class="subtitle">The Parks</h2>
        <p class="description">
          The Parks are a wealthy family who for four years have lived in their
          modernistic house designed by and the former residence of famed
          architect Namgoong. While Mr. and Mrs. Park are all about status, Mrs.
          Park has a flighty, simpleminded mentality and temperament, which Min
          tells Ki-woo to feel comfortable in lying to her about his education
          to get the job.

        <p class="description">
          In getting the job, Ki-woo further learns that Mrs. Park is looking
          for an art therapist for the Parks' adolescent son, Da-song, Ki-woo
          quickly recommending his professional art therapist friend "Jessica",
          really Ki-jung who he knows can pull off the scam in being the easiest
          liar of the four Kims.
        </p>
        <p class="description">
          In Ki-woo also falling for Da-hye, he begins to envision himself in
          that house, and thus the Kims as a collective start a plan for all the
          Kims, like Ki-jung using assumed names, to replace existing servants
          in the Parks' employ in orchestrating reasons for them to be fired.
          Finally, Chung-sook takes over as the Parks' housekeeper after the
          Kims exploit the peach allergy of the long-time housekeeper,
          Moon-gwang, to convince Mrs Park that she has tuberculosis.

          The question then becomes how far the Kims can take this scam in their
          quest to become their version of the Parks?
